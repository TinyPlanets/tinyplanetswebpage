        "What is the simplest solution?" - Oblique Stratagies<br>
        <br>
        Well, what to say here... Honestly, this has been one of the best educational experiences I've had. I had a few doubts early on, but my tutor Keira was amazingly supportive and encouraged me to continue.<br>
        <br>
        The mixture of classes and practical hands-on experience really appealed to the way in which I learn. We have learnt in three weeks a mixture of python, html, vs studio, web development/web design and game development in a team project.<br>
        <br>
        I love how you are encouraged to researh on your own and also collaborate with the other members of the course.<br>
        <br>
        How do I feel about coding? This is such an interesting question for me to answer, as I feel coding is, in a strange way, how I've been comfortably operating in the world most of my life, it's like a way of life. I find myself quickly dismissing myself as not being a coder though. I was offered an opportunity and threw myself at it, hoping to catch the bug I guess.<br>
        <br>
        Saying all that, I think I might be falling in love with web devopment/web design. Being given the tools to create something and then being left to create it is completly in my comfort zone.<br>
        <br>
        I believe in the CodeNation philosophy that anyone can and should code, it's a great way to look at coding.<br>
        <br>
        Basically, the future is already happening, I don't want to be left behind if I can help it... It's a little like being stuck in rut and then suddennly being presented with an infite amount of opportunities.<br>
        <br>
        Another analogy I can make is this: I was playing the platform/puzzle game Braid (a cool game where you manipulate time to solve puzzles). I got stuck on one of the levels, I stopped playing and went to bed. I had put the game completely out of my mind, but that night I dreamt that I worked out the solution, I woke up in the morning and remembering my dream I tried it out. It worked! It was such an odd, but amazing experience, that’s how I’ve felt over this course. That is a huge compliment to the course I have been involved in, I still tell people about how I sometimes dream about solutions to problems.
